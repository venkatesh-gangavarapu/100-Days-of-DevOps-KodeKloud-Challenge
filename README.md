## 👋 About This Challenge

This repository documents my **100-day hands-on AWS & DevOps journey** through [KodeKloud's free challenge](https://engineer.kodekloud.com/signup?referral=64ad88f5803455eea0a89ad5).

The goal isn't just to complete tasks — it's to approach each day the way you would in a real engineering team: understand the *why*, not just the *how*, and document it well enough that someone else could learn from it too.

Every day includes:
- ✅ What was built or configured
- 🔍 Key concepts applied
- 🧱 Real-world production context
- ⚠️ What broke and how it was fixed
- 📎 References and further reading

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This in Public

I've seen too many engineers treat learning as something you do privately, then show up with a certificate. That's fine — but it misses something.

**Doing this in public means:**
- Every mistake is documented and learned from, not hidden
- Other engineers at any stage can follow along and benefit
- The work speaks for itself — no need to oversell it on a resume

If you're early in your DevOps journey, **fork this repo and run the challenge yourself.** The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now.
